# Inventory_Management

This repository contains an inventory management system implemented in C.

## Description
The project includes three separate files for managing products, suppliers, and transactions respectively. This modular approach simplifies the code, which would otherwise be complex.

## Features
- Manage products, suppliers, and transactions
- Simplified and modular code structure

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/AdiXgit/Inventory_Management.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd Inventory_Management
   ```

## Usage
To use the inventory management system, compile and run the C files using a C compiler. For example:
```sh
gcc product.c -o product
./product
```
Repeat the same steps for `supplier.c` and `transaction.c`.
